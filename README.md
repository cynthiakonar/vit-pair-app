# VIT Pair App

This project proposes a data-driven solution by providing an algorithm that pairs freshmen with senior student mentors. 

Unlike traditional methods, our algorithm goes beyond just academic majors. It considers factors like living arrangements, geographical background, and language spoken. By creating these personalised connections based on shared experiences, this program aims to foster a more supportive environment and empower freshmen to navigate academics, social life, and campus resources with greater ease.
